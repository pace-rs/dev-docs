## Maskfile

We utilize `mask` to provide additional functionality for the development
process.

### Installation

Install `mask` with:

```bash
cargo install mask
```

or by using [`scoop`](https://scoop.sh/):

scoop install mask

A maskfile is self-documenting, because it is written in Markdown. You can view
