# Domain Language

## Introduction

A domain language is a set of terms and concepts that are specific to a
particular domain or subject area. In the context of Pace, the domain language
revolves around time tracking, productivity, and project management. By
establishing a clear and consistent domain language, you can ensure that users
understand the concepts and features of the tool and can use it effectively to
manage their time and tasks.

### 1. Activity

- **Explanation:** An activity refers to the broad category of work or personal
  projects the user is engaged in. For example, "Developing Feature X" or
  "Writing Blog Post". Activities encompass one or more tasks and represent a
  higher-level view of where time is being spent.

### 2. Task

- **Explanation:** A task is a specific action or piece of work to be completed
  as part of an activity. Tasks are the smallest unit of work and can be thought
  of as individual items on a to-do list, such as "Fix Bug #123" or "Outline
  Chapter 4".

### 3. Project

- **Explanation:** A project is a collection of activities (and therefore tasks)
  that are grouped together under a common goal or theme. Projects can be
  personal (e.g., "Learn Rust") or professional (e.g., "Website Redesign").

### 4. Session

- **Explanation:** A session represents a block of time spent working on a
  specific task or activity. Sessions are started and stopped by the user and
  are used to track how much time is spent on different tasks or activities
  within a project.

### 5. Tag

- **Explanation:** Tags are keywords or labels used to categorize tasks and
  activities further. They provide a flexible way to organize and filter time
  entries based on criteria like urgency, context (e.g., "Office", "Home"), type
  of work (e.g., "Coding", "Research"), or any other user-defined category.

### 6. Time Entry

- **Explanation:** A time entry is a record of a completed session. It includes
  the start and end times, the task or activity worked on, and any tags
  associated with that work. Time entries are the fundamental data points used
  for generating reports and insights into how time is spent.

### 7. Report

- **Explanation:** A report is a summary or analysis of time spent across tasks,
  activities, projects, and tags over a specified period. Reports can show total
  time spent, time spent per project or activity, trends over time, and other
  metrics that help users understand their productivity patterns.

### 8. Goal

- **Explanation:** A goal is a target amount of time the user aims to spend on a
  task, activity, or project within a certain period (e.g., "Spend 10 hours on
  Project X this week"). Goals help users manage their time effectively and stay
  focused on priorities.

### 9. Dashboard

- **Explanation:** The dashboard is a visual interface or summary view that
  displays key metrics, active sessions, recent time entries, and progress
  towards goals. It provides a quick overview of the user's time tracking status
  and achievements.

### 10. Integration

- **Explanation:** Integration refers to the ability of Pace to work alongside
  other tools or services, such as calendars, project management software, or
  invoicing tools. Integrations can help automate the tracking of time spent on
  meetings, tasks, or projects managed in other systems.

By defining these terms clearly, you establish a solid foundation for users to
understand and engage with Pace. This domain language not only facilitates
effective communication within the tool but also ensures users can leverage its
features to their full potential.

## More Advanced Concepts

Incorporating terms from GTD (Getting Things Done) and PARA (Projects, Areas,
Resources, Archives) methodologies can enhance the flexibility and utility of
Pace, making it a powerful tool for a wide range of time management and
productivity approaches. Here's an expansion of the domain-specific language to
include relevant GTD and PARA terms:

### GTD-specific Terms

#### 11. Inbox

- **Explanation:** The inbox in GTD is the initial collection point for all
  tasks, notes, ideas, and everything else that needs processing. In the context
  of Pace, an "Inbox" could be used to quickly capture time-sensitive tasks or
  activities before they are categorized.

#### 12. Next Actions

- **Explanation:** Next actions are the immediate next steps required to move a
  task or project forward. In Pace, users could tag sessions or tasks as "Next
  Actions" to prioritize them in their daily or weekly workflow.

#### 13. Projects (GTD Context)

- **Explanation:** In GTD, a project is defined as any outcome that requires
  more than one action step to achieve. This aligns with the general definition
  of projects in Pace but emphasizes the multi-step aspect of achieving specific
  goals.

#### 14. Contexts

- **Explanation:** Contexts in GTD are tags or labels that group tasks based on
  the location, tools, or conditions required to complete them (e.g., @Office,
  @Home, @Online). In Pace, contexts can help users organize time entries and
  sessions based on these criteria.

#### 15. Waiting For

- **Explanation:** This GTD term refers to tasks or actions that cannot progress
  until someone else completes a related action. In Pace, marking a session or
  task as "Waiting For" could help users keep track of time-dependent actions
  involving collaborations or external dependencies.

### PARA-specific Terms

#### 16. Areas

- **Explanation:** Areas in the PARA method represent spheres of activity with a
  standard to be maintained over time (e.g., Health, Finances, Professional
  Development). In Pace, users could categorize their activities and projects
  under specific areas to maintain a balanced overview of their commitments.

#### 17. Resources

- **Explanation:** Resources in PARA are thematic collections of information or
  tools for reference or inspiration (e.g., Articles, Courses, Tools). Though
  Pace primarily tracks time, it could allow users to link or reference
  resources associated with specific tasks, projects, or areas.

#### 18. Archives

- **Explanation:** Archives in PARA are where completed, inactive, or irrelevant
  projects and tasks are stored. In Pace, completed projects and activities
  could be moved to an archive section, helping users keep their active
  workspace clutter-free while retaining access to past records for reflection
  or analysis.

Incorporating these terms from GTD and PARA into Pace not only broadens its
applicability across different productivity systems but also provides users with
a more nuanced set of tools for managing their time and tasks. This approach
ensures that Pace can serve a wide array of users, from those seeking simple
time tracking to those looking for a more comprehensive productivity and time
management solution.
