# Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Task Management:**

- Ability to define and categorize tasks (e.g., by project, subject, business
  activity).
- Support for starting, pausing, resuming, and stopping task timers with simple
  commands.

1. **Pomodoro Technique Integration:**

- Timer functionality that supports customizable focus periods and break
  intervals.
- Notifications or alerts to indicate the end of focus periods and breaks.

1. **Reporting and Data Visualization:**

- Generation of summary reports showing total time spent on tasks, with
  breakdowns by category.
- Customizable report formats to include specific data points (e.g., daily
  summaries, project-based breakdowns).
- Visual representations of time spent, such as pie charts or bar graphs, for
  easier analysis.

1. **Data Export and Integration:**

- Options to export data and reports in JSON and CSV formats for external
  analysis or record-keeping.
- Compatibility with statistical applications or spreadsheets for further data
  manipulation.

1. **User Preferences and Customization:**

- Interface customization options to accommodate different user preferences and
  accessibility needs.
- Settings for Pomodoro lengths, notification types, and report details.

1. **Simple and Intuitive Interface:**

- A clear and straightforward command-line interface with guidance for
  beginners.
- Error handling with informative feedback to guide users through correcting
  inputs.

1. **Learning and Support:**

- In-app tutorials or help commands that provide usage instructions and tips.
- Documentation accessible from within the application for easy reference.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Usability:**

- The application should be easy to use for individuals with varying levels of
  technical proficiency, including those who are not familiar with command-line
  interfaces.
- The interface must be clean, with legible text and straightforward navigation.

1. **Accessibility:**

- Consideration for users with different abilities, including options for text
  size, contrast settings, and potentially voice commands or text-to-speech
  functionality for users like Susan.

1. **Performance:**

- The application should have minimal lag in starting, stopping, and switching
  between tasks.
- Reports and exports should be generated quickly, without significant wait
  times.

1. **Scalability:**

- The design should allow for the easy addition of new features, such as
  integration with other tools or cloud-based tracking, without major overhauls.

1. **Security and Privacy:**

- User data should be stored securely, with consideration for privacy,
  especially if future versions of the app include cloud storage or
  synchronization.

1. **Portability:**

- The application should be compatible with multiple operating systems, ensuring
  users can migrate or sync data across different platforms.

1. **Reliability:**

- The application must be reliable, with minimal bugs or crashes, especially
  during time tracking and report generation.

This overview of requirements serves as the foundation for the next steps in the
application development process, including system design, implementation, and
testing. By addressing these requirements, the development team can create a
time-tracking application that is versatile, user-friendly, and capable of
meeting the diverse needs of its intended user base.
